# Examples for "Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook" by Mark Watson

Note: this repo is very much a work in progress: I am working on a Haskell book:

[Haskell Tutorial and Cookbook](https://leanpub.com/haskell-cookbook)

The book should be done by the end of December 2016, and the examples in this repo should be in good enough shape to experiment with by the end of October 2016.
